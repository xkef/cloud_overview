# Cloud Overview

These are just a few quick links for managing the chaos of the big four.

## Google

[**Google Dashboard**](https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard)

> See and manage the data in your Google Account
> Your data includes the things you do, like searches,
> and the things you create, like email. Need a copy?
> Download your data

[**Google Ad Settings**](https://adssettings.google.com)

> How your ads are personalized
> Ads are based on personal info you've added to your
> Google Account, data from advertisers that partner
> with Google, and Google's estimation of your
> interests. Choose any factor to learn more or update
> your preferences.

Google is one of many ad networks that personalizes ads based on your activity online.

Go to Your [Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) to control ads
from other ad networks.

[**Google My Activity**](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity)

> Only you can see this data. Google protects your privacy and
> security.

[**Google Activity Controls**](https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols)

There is a new attempt of google towards GDPR compliance, which I found
generally pretty informational:

[**How Google Search works**](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/)

> How Search works For a typical query, there are thousands, even millions, of
> webpages with potentially relevant information.
> So, how does Google figure out what to show in your search results? Well, the
> journey starts before you even type your search…



## Apple

[**Apple ID**](https://appleid.apple.com/)

> Your account for everything Apple.
> A single Apple ID and password gives you access to all Apple
> services. Learn more about Apple ID

[**Apple iCloud**](https://www.icloud.com/)

> iCloud securely stores your photos, videos, documents, music,
> apps, and more—and keeps them updated across all your devices.
> It lets you easily share photos, calendars, locations, and more
> with friends and family. You can even use iCloud to help you find
> your device if you lose it.

Learn more [here](https://help.apple.com/icloud) in the *help documentation*.

[**Apple apple.com Your Account**](https://www.apple.com/shop/account/home)

>     - Track, modify, or cancel an order, or make a return.

*However, I think it is only possible to manage subscriptions of
products purchased in Apple Store / iTunes through iTunes App or
through iOS Settings ⇢ Apple ID ⇢ iTunes & App Store and click
on the top link.*

## Microsoft

*Beware that you have a construct of two systems here:*

[**Microsoft Account**](https://account.microsoft.com/)
and
[**Office 365**](https://www.office.com/)


> *Why you need a Microsoft Account*
>
> Using a Microsoft account and linking it with your Office for home product
> connects you to various Microsoft products and services, and makes it simple
> to reinstall Office without a product key.
>
> *Note: Linking a Microsoft account with Office only applies to Office 365 Home,
> Personal, or University, or Office 2013 or newer versions such as Office Home
> and Student, Office Home and Business, Office Professional and some versions
> of Office Professional Plus.*
>
> * A Microsoft account is required to install and activate Office versions 2013 or later, and Office 365 for home products.
>
> * You might already have a Microsoft account if you use a service like Outlook.com, OneDrive, Xbox Live, or Skype; or if you purchased Office from the online Microsoft Store.
>
> * If you don't have a Microsoft account yet, you’ll be asked to create one the first time you install or activate your copy of Office.
>
> * When you link your Microsoft account to Office, it means anytime you want to install or reinstall Office you won't need to re-enter your product key, or hang on to an installation disc or thumb drive.
> * If you use Office 365, you can add your credit card information to your
> Microsoft account and turn on recurring billing so Office is always available.


## Cloud Computing

[**Google Cloud**](https://cloud.google.com/)

Try [colab](https://colab.research.google.com), it gives you a
Jupyter Notebook and free GPU computing with your personal
Google Account.

[**Amazon Web Services**](https://aws.amazon.com/)

A lot of the Internet runs through this. I think Netflix is an
example.

[**Microsoft Azure**](https://portal.azure.com)

Interesting approach towards data science and their bet on
python in general.
